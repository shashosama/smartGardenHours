#  Project 2 â€“ Gardening & Air Quality Data Analysis

This project explores how environmental air quality impacts plant growth by analyzing real-world datasets using R. It was developed as part of a data science coursework project and includes both the code and report.

##  Files

- `daily_44201_2024.csv`: Air quality data (e.g., ozone levels).
- `plant_growth_data.csv`: Observations of plant growth under various conditions.
- `project2R&S.Rmd`: Main R Markdown file with data cleaning, visualization, and analysis code.
- `project2R-S.pdf`: Final rendered PDF report with findings and visualizations.

##  Objectives

- Clean and merge air quality and plant growth datasets.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize the best time for gardening based on environmental indicators.
- Provide insights to gardeners about ideal planting hours.

## Tools that were Used

- R
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- plotly
- RMarkdown

##  How to Run

1. Open `project2R&S.Rmd` in RStudio.
2. Install required packages if not already installed (`tidyverse`, `plotly`, etc.).
3. Knit the RMarkdown file to generate the final report.
